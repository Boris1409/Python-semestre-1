Watched the final 10 minutes on YouTube and it's just as tedious as the rest of the game is. Very funny, nihilistic ending though which almost made me give the game two stars if it wasn't for literally everything else here. At least it's mostly funny-bad instead of boring-bad. Not by much though (like 60-40) and it's still just an overall torturous experience. They really did double-down on the ring levels here and while it can be somewhat of a thrill when you're going super fast performing a tricky maneuver of hastily placed/moving rings there's just SO many of these levels and they go on FOREVER. Almost lost my mind a few times here. Still those levels are more competent than any of the actual mission objectives and their asinine level designs. Definitely a rushed game to say the least."", 'this is only getting a half a star bump up because i kinda love how broken this game is, its really funny to mess around with friends', 'no es un videojuego']",859,2,76,55

Mega Man X7,"Jul 17, 2003","['Capcom Production Studio 3', 'Capcom']",1.4,231,231,"['Adventure', 'Platform']","The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century, during an age when humans coexist with humanoid robots called ""Reploids"". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the ""Maverick Hunters"" has been established to stamp out this activity. Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X retires, tired from the never-ending battles. A new group of vigilantes, Red Alert, is introduced. One of their members, Axl, decides he has had enough of their ""murdering"" and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.","['Talvez um dos Mega mans mais injustiçados.\n                     \n                     MMX7 é um ambicioso salto para uma franquia que ainda engatinhava no mundo 3D e o resultado, por mais que não seja tão gracioso, ainda diverte e concentra muitas qualidades que vemos nos demais jogos da série X.\n                     \n                     A trilha sonora é fantástica, os chefes são desafiadores e criativos em seu design e, claro, a ação ainda é frenética, senão um pouco lenta para os padrões vistos nos MM 2D.\n                     \n                     Joguem a versão da legacy collection, ela estabiliza a fremerate e deixa os carregamentos mais curtos.', ""I don't think I had fun with this game even once\n                     \n                     It's sad.

One way they could have done shooting was like Ratchet & Clank just having some sort of Crosshair, the thing is the way they made 3D just does not work at all they made the camera look up instead of behind the player yk like how a fucking 3D game that works, and the thing is the 2D doesn’t even fucking work in this game with enemies still acting in a 3D environment It makes it a pain in the ass dealing with enemies that the lock-on barely works with enemies that are in the background or foreground it’s so fucking bad and makes me realize that X7 has the most bland level design when it comes to 2D legit the last stages are almost as difficult as the opening stages from X1-6 it’s really dumb and ridiculously easy for it, honestly i could go on with the story, character misinterpretation or newcomers (i fucking hate Axl), but im just tired of talking about this game this is the most dogshit game I have played and if you want to be like me and play every X game please just skip this game If you want to play the Mega Man X games because they are something I really adore I’m just really upset at how Capcom treats MM no matter if It’s a subseries or not.', ""Even the DMC 2 gauge is more fun to operate than Axel's gauge in this game.""]",1.3K,6,385,113
